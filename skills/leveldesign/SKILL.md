# UEFN Level Design — place things CORRECTLY

The #1 level-design failure is placing blind: guessing coordinates, stacking
actors inside each other, floating props. These tools give you the spatial
facts first — sizes, gaps, free space, ground height — so every placement is
deliberate.

## Multi-area maps FIRST (Hub / Store / Arena / …)

When the user wants a **new area**, hub, store, lobby, arena, or separate
“level” footprint — do **not** invent cubes at the origin. Call:

```
area_list()
area_create({"area_id": "hub", "preset": "hub", "seed": 42})
# next area lands 100000 uu away automatically
area_create({"area_id": "store", "preset": "store", "seed": 43})
save_current_level()
```

Each area gets its own mesh terrain + `Areas/<id>/{Terrain,Blockout,Devices,Props,Foliage}`.
Presets: `blockout_list_presets` → hub | store | arena | corridor | lobby.
Always-on rules: `area_management` (injected into the skill prompt). Real Landscape
Mode Create is manual-only — AI path is `terrain_generate` via `area_create`.

## The spatial toolkit (flat MCP tools)

| Question | Tool |
|----------|------|
| How big is it? | `get_actor_bounds` (origin/extent/min/max/size) |
| How big is the level? | `get_level_bounds` |
| How far apart are these two? | `measure_distance` (center dist + SURFACE gap) |
| Does a box fit here? | `check_area_clear` |
| Where DOES it fit near here? | `find_clear_area` (nearest spots first) |
| How high is the floor? | `get_ground_z` |
| **New named area / greybox** | `area_list`, `area_create`, `blockout_list_presets`, `blockout_layout` |
| **Move/arrange** | `set_actor_transform`, `snap_actor_to_ground`, `snap_actor_to_grid`, `align_actors`, `distribute_actors`, `attach_actor`, `duplicate_actor` |
| **Organize** | `set_actor_label`, `set_actor_folder`, `set_actor_tags` |

## Fortnite Content Drawer → MCP (Props / Prefabs / Devices)

Content Drawer **All → Fortnite → Props / Prefabs / Devices** is a **UI gallery**, not
`directory="/Fortnite"` (that path is empty). Placeable Creative content is under
`/Game/Creative/...`. Before inventing cubes or guessing paths, load:

`skill_read_subskill("leveldesign", "content_catalog")`

Quick map:

| Drawer | Search under | Devices API (Verse types) |
|--------|--------------|---------------------------|
| Props (walls, floors, clutter) | `/Game/Creative/BuildingActors/{Walls,Floors,Roofs,Props}`, `/Game/Creative/Environments/...`, `/Game/Creative/Sets/<Theme>` | — |
| Prefabs / themed kits | `/Game/Creative/Sets/<Theme>` (no `/Game/Creative/Prefabs` mount) | Scene Graph prefabs → `scenegraph` skill |
| Devices | `/Game/Creative/Devices` (or `/Game/Creative`) → spawn `…_C` | `list_verse_types(digest="fortnite", kind="class", name_filter="_device")` → `get_verse_api` |

Always `search_assets(search=…, directory=…)` — never `query` / `name_filter`.

## Golden path (precise few-prop placement)

```
get_asset_info / get_actor_bounds        # 1. know the SIZE
find_clear_area({"near": [x,y,z], "extent": [ex,ey,ez]})   # 2. know it FITS
spawn_actor({"asset_path": "...", "location": <spot>})     # 3. place (one call per actor)
snap_actor_to_ground({"actor_path": "<label>"})            # 4. no floating props
set_actor_label + set_actor_folder                         # 5. ALWAYS organize — never Outliner root
take_high_res_screenshot / set_viewport_camera             # 6. LOOK at it (use returned path/media_url)
save_current_level()
```

**ALWAYS folder every place** — `set_actor_folder` after every spawn/label. Prefer
`Areas/<id>/Devices`, `Areas/<id>/Props` (from `area_create`). Legacy nesting
(`Hub/Spawners`, `Blockout/COMBAT`) still ok inside an area. See `area_management`
and `blockout_playtest`.

**Screenshots:** call `take_high_res_screenshot` → use the returned project `path`
(`Saved/Screenshots`) / `media_url`. Chat snips go to `Saved/DuckyCaptures`.
AppData `capture_path` / `tool_captures` / snips folders are preview-only — if you
need the file for import/Blender, copy into the project first. Never Bash
`find` / `ls` for `uefn_ducky_screenshot.png`.

Use this for devices, landmarks, and small arrangements. Rows/fences: spawn one at
a time (or a short loop), then `align_actors` + `distribute_actors`.

## Greybox / large blockout golden path (cities, forests, districts)

**Named areas (hub/store/arena/…):** prefer `area_create` + presets (above) over
hand-rolled scripts.

When the user asks for a **large custom** greybox (dozens–hundreds of cubes) that
is not a preset, **do not** issue hundreds of `spawn_actor` turns. Prefer **one**
`execute_python` call that loops `EditorLevelLibrary.spawn_actor_from_object`
(still one heavy MCP call — never parallel heavies). Folder under `Areas/<id>/…`
or `Blockout/…`.

```
1. area_list / get_level_bounds + check_area_clear   # find empty footprint / slot
2. create_material (Materials plugin)      # water / stone / wall / building / roof
3. execute_python                          # ONE script: place meshes, set_actor_label,
                                           # set_folder_path / folders, assign materials
4. set_viewport_camera + screenshot        # verify
5. save_current_level()
```

Notes:

- Cube mesh: `/Engine/BasicShapes/Cube.Cube` (100 uu). Scale accordingly.
- Call `uefn_editor_python_hints` before writing materials/Python if unsure.
- Folders: e.g. `BlockoutCity/Canal_Water`, `Building_Island_01`, `Perimeter_Walls`,
  `Forest/ForestExit`, `Castle` — everything in its own Outliner folder.
- Budget: hundreds of actors OK; prefer bigger combined masses over thousands of
  tiny props.
- Never `os.walk` Fortnite install / AppData from `execute_python`.
- Still one heavy editor tool per assistant message — one bulk Python script is OK.

## UEFN metrics (rules of thumb — verify in playtest)

- 1 uu = 1 cm. The Fortnite **build grid is 512 uu** per cell (floors 512×512,
  a wall story ≈ 384 uu tall) — layouts that respect multiples of 512/384 feel
  native and stay build-fight compatible.
- Player is ~190 uu tall: keep walk-through openings ≥ 256 uu wide and
  ≥ 384 uu tall; combat lanes 2+ cells wide.
- `snap_actor_to_grid` with 512 (structures), 128 (props), 64 (detail).
- `get_ground_z` reports its `method`: "trace" is exact; "aabb_fallback" is a
  bounds approximation — trust it on flat floors, re-check slopes visually.

## Hard rules

- **Bounds are AABB** (axis-aligned): rotated long props report bigger boxes —
  after big rotations re-read bounds before trusting gaps.
- **`check_area_clear` before choosing a site**; for bulk Python loops, clear the
  footprint first, then place from a deterministic seed.
- **Verify visually.** After a group of placements: frame it with
  `set_viewport_camera`, `take_high_res_screenshot`, and actually look.
- Deep-dives: see **Reference files** below. Complete mode order:
  `skill_read_subskill("leveldesign", "full_game_director")`.

## Full game (mode, not just a pretty map)

When the user wants a **playable match**, start with the director — not theme art:

`skill_read_subskill("leveldesign", "full_game_director")`

Typical chain: islandsettings → greybox → `blockout_playtest` → `player_flow` →
`combat_spaces` → `spawn_and_fairness` → `objectives_in_space` /
`zones_and_boundaries` → Verse `sys_architecture` → dress (`theme_recipes`,
`lighting`, `cinematic_composition`).

## Lighting (mood / day-night / flat gray)

Prefer one key Directional + Sky, then few local Point/Spot accents. Day Sequence
for time-of-day cycles. Always screenshot after tweaks:
`skill_read_subskill("leveldesign", "lighting")`.

## Terrain & foliage (worldgen)

Prefer `worldgen_capabilities` → `terrain_generate` → `foliage_list_sources` →
`foliage_scatter` over placing one tree actor at a time. Details:
`skill_read_subskill("leveldesign", "landscape_foliage")`.

## After ANY layout change

`save_current_level()` — placements are level data.
