## Landscape & foliage — worldgen tools

UEFN-Ducky can **form terrain** and **scatter vegetation as instances**, but foliage
still needs source meshes / FoliageTypes. The win is avoiding one StaticMeshActor
per tree and avoiding hundreds of terrain cubes.

### Capability probe first

```
worldgen_capabilities()
→ terrain_backend: mesh | unavailable
→ landscape_create: unavailable
→ landscape_sculpt_existing: noop_no_visible_change
→ foliage_backend: hism | static_mesh_actors | unavailable
```

- **mesh** terrain (`terrain_generate`) = GeometryScript heightfield — the AI create+sculpt path that works.
- **Real Landscape create with panels is unavailable from Python** on this UEFN build:
  `spawn_actor(Landscape)` → `LandscapePlaceholder` (0 panels). Panels live on
  `LandscapeStreamingProxy`. Only Landscape Mode → **Create** builds them.
  T3D shows `ComponentSizeQuads` / `GridSize`, but those props are not Python-editable.
  Call `landscape_create` for the structured unavailable response + UI steps; after
  Create, call `landscape_rename`. Use `landscape_list` / `landscape_get_info` for panels.
- **Landscape sculpt via Python is a verified NO-OP on visible terrain.** `landscape_export/import_heightmap_from_render_target` exist and the data round-trips (export reads back what import wrote), but importing a full white/max heightmap left the terrain perfectly flat with proxy bounds Z unchanged — even after `force_layers_full_update()`. So `landscape_sculpt` (verify/add/set) writes only a buffer, not geometry. **For AI-sculpted terrain use `terrain_generate` (mesh).** `landscape_sculpt` is retained for parity in case a future engine build composites imports.
- **Default foliage (`auto`/`actors`)**: tagged StaticMeshActors reusing source meshes.
  HISM often does not render; IFA crashes. Cap actor demos ≤120; `foliage_clear_generated`.
- **`placement_mode='hism'`**: experimental HISM containers.

### Golden path (demo biome)

```
worldgen_capabilities({})
check_area_clear / find_clear_area          # pick empty footprint
terrain_generate({
  location, size_uu: 12800, resolution: 65, seed: 42,
  stamps: [
    {type:"hill", x:-2000, y:0, radius:2500, height:1200},
    {type:"valley", x:2000, y:500, radius:2200, height:900},
    {type:"flatten", x:0, y:0, radius:1800, height:0, strength:1}
  ],
  level_folder: "Generated/WorldgenDemo"
})
foliage_list_sources({search:"tree"})
foliage_scatter({
  center, extent, sources:[...], seed:42,
  density_per_100m2: 6, min_distance: 400, max_instances: 250,
  clear_first: true, level_folder: "Generated/WorldgenDemo"
})
set_viewport_camera + take_high_res_screenshot
save_current_level()
```

### Hard rules

- One heavy editor command per turn (`terrain_generate`, `foliage_scatter`, …).
- Deterministic `seed` required; report it.
- Regenerate = `terrain_remove_generated` / `foliage_clear_generated` then rebuild.
- Budget: resolution ≤ 129; instances ≤ 2500 (default demo ≪ that).
- Never scale Creative devices. Foliage scale variance is fine on props only.
- Organize under `Generated/WorldgenDemo` and tag `WorldgenGenerated`.
